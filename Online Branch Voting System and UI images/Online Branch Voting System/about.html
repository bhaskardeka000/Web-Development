<p id="l2">Vote plus is a web-based voting system designed to manage your votings easily and securely. This voting system can be used for casting votes of various departments in colleges etc. In this system, students do not have to go to colleges to cast their votes. They can use their computer or smartphone to cast their votes. There is a database which contains all the names and roll numbers of the voter. All they need is to fill-up the form provided in the website to cast their votes. Also, they can share their feedback if they want to. The advantages of online voting is that the students have
    their own choices of voting at their own free time and there is reduced congestion. Note: Admin can access the database to see the final result. Results can be declared only by the admin.</p>
